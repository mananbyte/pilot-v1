## How It Works

### 1. New Arrivals Strategy
- **New Arrivals** links point to specific "new" collections that contain only recent products
- These collections should be manually curated or use automated conditions based on:
  - Product creation date (last 30-60 days)
  - Product tags (e.g., "new-arrival", "latest")
  - Inventory status (recently added)

### 2. All Products Strategy
- **All Products** links point to broader collections that include both old and new items
- These are your main product category collections
- They show the complete catalog for each product type

### 3. Fallback Mechanism
- If a specific "new" collection doesn't exist, the route automatically redirects to the main collection with filters:
  - Sorted by creation date (newest first)
  - Filtered by product type
  - Shows available products only

## Collection Setup Examples

### In Shopify Admin:

#### Collection: "mens-new-shalwar-kameez"
- **Conditions**: 
  - Product type = "Shalwar Kameez"
  - Product vendor = "Your Brand"
  - Product created date > 30 days ago
  - OR Product tags contain "new-arrival"

#### Collection: "mens-shalwar-kameez" 
- **Conditions**:
  - Product type = "Shalwar Kameez"
  - Product vendor = "Your Brand"
  - Product status = Active

#### Collection: "kids-new-boys"
- **Conditions**: 
  - Product type = "Boys Clothing"
  - Product vendor = "Your Brand"
  - Product created date > 30 days ago
  - Age range tags contain "0-12"
  - OR Product tags contain "new-arrival"

#### Collection: "kids-boys" 
- **Conditions**:
  - Product type = "Boys Clothing"
  - Product vendor = "Your Brand"
  - Age range tags contain "0-12"
  - Product status = Active

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Scalability**: Easy to add new categories and subcategories
2. **Marketing Focus**: Highlight new products separately
3. **User Experience**: Clear distinction between new and all products
4. **SEO Friendly**: Each collection has its own URL and can be optimized
5. **Future Proof**: Can easily expand with seasonal collections, special editions, etc.

## Future Expansion Examples

When you grow, you can easily add:

```
- mens-winter-collection
- mens-summer-2025
- womens-bridal-collection
- mens-premium-line
- limited-edition
```

## Route Structure Implementation

The route files handle the logic:
- `/app/routes/($locale).collections.mens.new.$productType.tsx`
- `/app/routes/($locale).collections.womens.new.$productType.tsx`
- `/app/routes/($locale).collections.kids.new.$productType.tsx`

These routes automatically:
1. Check if specific "new" collection exists
2. Redirect to appropriate collection with filters if needed
3. Provide fallback for missing collections

This ensures your navigation always works, even if you haven't created all collections yet!
