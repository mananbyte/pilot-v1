const ENHANCED_COLLECTION_QUERY = `#graphql
  query enhancedCollection(
    $handle: String!
    $filters: [ProductFilter!]
    $sortKey: ProductCollectionSortKeys!
    $reverse: Boolean
    $first: Int
    $season: String
    $occasion: String
  ) @inContext(country: $country, language: $language) {
    collection(handle: $handle) {
      # ... existing fields
      products(
        first: $first
        filters: $filters
        sortKey: $sortKey
        reverse: $reverse
      ) {
        # Enhanced product data with seasonal info
        nodes {
          ...ProductCard
          seasonalInfo: metafield(namespace: "custom", key: "seasonal_item") {
            value
          }
          occasionTags: metafield(namespace: "custom", key: "occasion_tags") {
            value
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

### Smart Collection Utils
```typescript
// app/utils/smart-collections.ts
export function getSeasonalRecommendations(season: string, category: string) {
  // Logic for seasonal product recommendations
}

export function determineCurrentSeason() {
  // Auto-detect current season based on date/location
}

export function categorizeProduct(product: Product) {
  // Auto-categorize products based on tags/attributes
}
```

### Enhanced Badge System
```typescript
// app/components/product/enhanced-badges.tsx
export function EnhancedProductBadges({ product, season, context }) {
  // Smarter badge logic based on context
  // - Show seasonal badges when relevant
  // - Show school badges for kids section
  // - Show new arrival badges with countdown
}
```
